## Amazon Bedrock AI Stylist lab

This hands-on lab, aimed at developers and solution builders, introduces easy way to use choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) with a single API to create a business solution tailored to fit a use case.

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to FMs from third-party providers and Amazon; available via an API. With Bedrock, you can choose from a variety of models to find the one thatâ€™s best suited for your use case.

Within this labs, you'll explore some of the most common usage patterns we are seeing with our customers for Generative AI. We will show techniques for generating text and images, creating value for organizations by improving productivity. You will gain hands-on experience implementing these patterns via Bedrock APIs and SDKs, as well as open-source software like [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) and [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/index.html).
